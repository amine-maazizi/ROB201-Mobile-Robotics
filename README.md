# ROB201-Mobile-Robotics Repository

This repository, *ROB201-Mobile-Robotics*, contains my work for the ROB201 course at ENSTA Paris, an introduction to mobile robotics. The course covers core algorithms for mapping, localization, and planning using a Lidar sensor. It includes an in-depth study of the tinySLAM algorithm applied to Lidar data. The up-to-date version of this code is available at: [GitHub repository *ROB201-Mobile-Robotics*](https .com/emmanuel-battesti/ensta-rob201).

## Setup

To use this repository, clone it to install the code and dependencies. The [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file provides instructions for Ubuntu and Windows. For macOS, follow the Ubuntu instructions with minor adjustments.

## Place-Bot Simulator

The project uses the **Place-Bot** simulator, which is installed automatically. See the [**Place-Bot** GitHub repository](https://github.com/emmanuel-battesti/place-bot) and its [documentation](https://github.com/emmanuel-battesti/place-bot#readme) for details on its functionality.

## Submission

At the end of the course, the complete repository will be submitted as a zip file to the instructor.

## Contact

For questions about the code or *Place-Bot*, contact the instructor at: emmanuel.battesti@ensta-paris.fr.
